1. Can I use matching double quotes for string literals instead of single quotes? Yes


2. Can I compare strings using comparison operators such as = and < or built-in functions such as max() and min()? Yes, Python uses lexicographic order to compare two strings like words in a bookindex or dictionary. Example. 'hello' and 'hello' are equal' 'hello' and 'goodbye' are unequal and 'goodbye' is less than 'hello'

yes

3. What does the expression 1/0 evaluate to in Python?

Error




4. Is there a difference between = and ==? Yes
(=)- it is an assignment operator that assigns a value to a variable example is a = 6
(==)- it is an assigned operator that checks if the 2 experssions give the same value / identical


5. Will a = b = c = 17 set the three variables to 17? Yes
rint("a=17")
print("b=17")
print("c=17")
a=17
b=17
c=17




6. Give the value of a after the execution of each of the following sequences:
a = 1
a = a + a
a = a + a
a = a + a
a = True
a = not a
a = not a
a = not a
a = 2
a = a * a
a = a * a
a = a * a
Answer= 256
